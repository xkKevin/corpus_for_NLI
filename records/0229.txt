I am a first-year master student in the CAD Lab of Zhejiang University. We are studying a corpus of visualization-oriented NLI based on task classification. I want to create an application on a Text-to-SQL Task. Know your TypeSQL: Knowledge-based type perception neural text to SQL generation papers, the TypeSQL + TC method proposed in the test set is 80% to 90% accurate, so I want to use your trained model to apply to our data set.

Is it convenient to share a pre-trained TypeSQL model?

Thank you very much and wish you a happy life and keep learning!
