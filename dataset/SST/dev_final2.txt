0.27778 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .

0.30556 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen .

0.083333 an unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse .
0.18056 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work .

0.79167 a working class `` us vs. them '' opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered .
0.34722 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
0.20833 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .

0.40278 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough .

0.41667 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures .
0.22222 zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight .

0.25 when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie .
0.58333 while it 's nice to watch a movie that has n't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu 's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold .
0.19444 it treats women like idiots .
0.41667 though catch me if you can is n't badly made , the fun slowly leaks out of the movie .
0.58333 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time .
0.27778 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba .
0.22222 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly .
0.33333 for starters , the story is just too slim .
0.625 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie .
0.18056 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not .
0.5 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power .
0.30556 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death .
0.15278 almost gags on its own gore .
0.43056 it 's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show .
0.097222 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess 's home video of their baby 's birth .
0.29167 while ( hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film .

0.18056 the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty .
0.27778 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .
0.18056 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .
0.041667 you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they 'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this .
0.20833 in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest .
0.22222 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum .
0.19444 well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull .
0.23611 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers .
0.47222 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film 's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy .
0.56944 this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash .
0.45833 yes , ballistic is silly .
0.125 unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
0.43056 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
0.23611 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
0.30556 while it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc. ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
0.11111 not only unfunny , but downright repellent .
0.34722 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman 's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters .
0.25 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending .
0.36111 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in - the-blanks with a tragic past .
0.19444 k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension .
0.43056 has a long and clunky ending ... which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience 's awkward silence
0.45833 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking .
0.18056 whaley 's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting .
0.34722 uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions .
0.30556 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad .
0.16667 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience 's chain .
0.097222 confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it .
0.22222 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss .
0.44444 it 's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center .
0.38889 holden caulfield did it better .
0.29167 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness .
0.27778 oh come on .
0.13889 like you could n't smell this turkey rotting from miles away .
0.48611 if it 's seldom boring , well , it 's also rarely coherent .
0.43056 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy .
0.34722 not exactly the bees knees
0.23611 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they 're being streamed over a 28k modem .
0.5 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated .
0.51389 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment ... but at least this time there 's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff .
0.34722 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey 's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment .
0.47222 jacquot 's rendering of puccini 's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera .
0.43056 in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .
0.31944 chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama .
0.11111 it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker .
0.44444 this is nothing but familiar territory .
0.23611 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space .
0.027778 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year .
0.20833 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that 's pretty toxic in its own right .
0.23611 too slow , too long and too little happens .
0.16667 the film 's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency .
0.25 it 's just filler .
0.38889 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance .
0.20833 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni 's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film .

0.15278 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence .
0.33333 it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job .
0.40278 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending .
0.47222 barely gets off the ground .
0.31944 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller 's hand often feels unsure .
0.29167 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut .
0.66667 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s .
0.097222 at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .
0.29167 from the opening scenes , it 's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie .
0.11111 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as ` worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that .
0.58333 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura 's best work since the xfl .
0.52778 despite impeccable acting ... and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end .
0.30556 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) .
0.27778 by getting myself wrapped up in the visuals and eccentricities of many of the characters , i found myself confused when it came time to get to the heart of the movie .
0.11111 too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance .
0.47222 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor .
0.22222 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite .
0.31944 do not see this film .
0.625 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
0.375 delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas .
0.26389 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday .
0.23611 to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be .
0.097222 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i 'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey .
0.47222 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con .
0.22222 i 'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here .
0.43056 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace .
0 it 's like every bad idea that 's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs ' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) .
0.29167 while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these .
0.36111 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one .
0.52778 to my taste , the film 's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation .
0.30556 what the director ca n't do is make either of val kilmer 's two personas interesting or worth caring about .
0.23611 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy .
0.13889 it 's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here 's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .
0.54167 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment .
0.38889 ... nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects .
0.31944 it 's not that kung pow is n't funny some of the time -- it just is n't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk 's impish augmentation .
0.19444 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .
0.11111 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions .
0.18056 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left .
0.33333 once ( kim ) begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it 's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard .
0.16667 the words , ` frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate .
0.47222 what 's next : `` my mother the car ? ''
0.23611 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal ca n't disguise the fact that , really , we 've been here , done that .
0.23611 a sequel that 's much too big for its britches .
0 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines .
0.33333 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian .
0.43056 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments .
0.27778 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there 's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love 's dissolution .
0.29167 a coarse and stupid gross-out .
0.27778 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes .
0.30556 does n't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces ... that raise the bar on stylized screen violence .
0.45833 there 's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route .
0.15278 it 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
0.48611 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
0.18056 but the power of these ( subjects ) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .
0.27778 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .
0.29167 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar .
0.18056 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma 's scarface .
0.30556 that 's a cheat .
0.68056 harrison 's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all .
0.125 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .
